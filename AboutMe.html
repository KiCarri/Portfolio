<div>  <h1> Kirsten! </h1> I am 16 years old and I live with my mother and younger siblings in New York City.
   I want to create a website for my mother because she wants to create a website for an online dress store she wants to open.
I enjoy helping out with my younger siblings even though they are not the most reasonable at times.</div>
    <div> I <em> really </em> hate cats. They can be cute... </div>

    <div> But they are evil and they make me sneeze.

  <p>  Fun fact: My passion is Law and History, not coding. I have an interest in it, but more as a skill rather than a career.
    But I am 100% interested in History. There are things we will never know and maybe one day technology will help us fill in those gaps. </p>
